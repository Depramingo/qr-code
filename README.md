## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   This was my first "actual" project ever, I mean one where I understood every single line of code I wrote, I wasn't scared or anxious. I didn't freeze. I just kept on going and whenever I encountered an issue, I just looked for the solution. And whenever I encountered something new, I just learned it.

-   I learned Git & Github.. yes, I didn't know how to use them before I started this project, had them for a while tho.
-   I learned how to add icons in the HTML file:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png" type="image/png" />
```

-   learned a lot of CSS:

```css
.all-these {
    box-sizing: border-box, content-box;
    max-width: 100%;
    min-height: 100vh;
    transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
    transform: scale(1.01);
}
```

-   learned about CSS cubic-bezier as well.. but didn't use it here
-   Learned CSS @media queries as well

### Continued development

-   CSS cubic-bezier function
-   CSS transition & transform properties
